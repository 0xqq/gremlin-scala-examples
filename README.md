## Gremlin-Scala examples
A collection of example projects that use Gremlin-Scala. This is to get newbies started - just choose your graph db and
off you go!

I am depending on your help - please add more graph dbs and more examples - and send me a pull request. 

### Usage
First install jdk 8 and configure it to be your `JAVA_HOME` and in your path (check with `echo $JAVA_HOME` and `java -version`). 
```
cd XYZ #e.g. neo4j
sbt run
```
